# coqprime

CoqPrime is a library built on top of the Coq proof system to certify primality using Pocklington certificate and Elliptic Curve Certificate. It is a nice illustration of what we can do with safe computation inside a prover. The library consists of 4 main parts:

* A library of facts from number theory: the goal was to prove the theorems relative to Pocklington certificate. The library includes some very nice theorems like Lagrange theorem, Euler-Fermat theorem.
* A library for elliptic curves
* An efficient library to perform modular arithmetic: using the standard representation of integers in Coq was not sufficient to tackle large prime numbers so we have developped our own modular arithmetic based on tree-like structures. The library includes comparison, successor, predecessor, complement, addition, subtraction, multiplication, square, division, square root, gcd, power and modulo.
* A C program that ```pocklington``` generates Pocklington certificates (this program is based on [ECM](https://ecm.gforge.inria.fr)). An ocaml program ```o2v``` that turns a certificate generated by [primo](https://www.ellipsa.eu) into Coq files. These programs are in
[gencertif](./gencertif).

* This version is compatible with primo version 4.3.1.
  You need to set the flag ```Elliptic curve tests only```
  in the ```SetUp```. Also, you must add in the configuration file ```primo.ini``` (this file is generated
  after the first invocation of primo), the lines

  ```
  [Undocumented]
  SHB=FALSE
